                    <p>Young India Leadership Program aims to refine the crude embellishments by designing a series
                        of virtues, for each soul to learn from insight stirring, and composite experiences. We aim
                        to gather the masses to witness a journey of paramount life skills coalesced with a tinge of
                        self-confidence in each one. The partakers would be groomed by eminent speakers of the country
                        and equipped with cardinal
                        attributes such as leadership, communication and personality skills, teamwork, research
                        work, panache, interpersonal relations, courage, and initiation abilities.</p>
