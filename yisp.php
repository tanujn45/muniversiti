                    <h1>About the Program</h1>
                    <p>Young India Summer Program is ought to beautifully facilitate the exchange of students
                        through muniversified schools. The school will be able to send its students to varied
                        institutions so as to provide them with regional exposure as well as inculcate in them a
                        sense of responsibility. YISP happens to be the only program that is residential with an
                        effective impartation within a span of 8-15 days. It further plans to host a series of workshops
                        varying from entrepreneurship to theatrics to
                        promote practical learning. This would be primarily facilitated through the pyramid model of
                        development wherein the students would be able to construct basics and expand them to reach
                        the pinnacle of erudition.</p>
